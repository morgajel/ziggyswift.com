This was a story I overheard from Gurgan the Ogre and his buddies after Gurgan looked into a hole.

> &lt;Gurgan&gt; HEY. You see hole?
> 
> &lt;Duk&gt; yah
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt;yah
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; You look in?
> 
> &lt;Duk&gt; nah
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt;\*shrug\*
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; Gurgan look in. Dorf call it a-biss. I look in and it look back. It show me things. Gurgan hollow like it.
> 
> &lt;Duk&gt; \*clueless stare\*
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; We hollow, like it. Gurgan have no meaning. Dorf have meaning- to dig. Elf have meaning- to hug tree. Gnomes have meaning- to make stuffs. Even Orc have meaning- to make noise when squished.
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt; We have meaning! We eat gobins and move rocks for shinies.
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; But why? It not make meaning for Gurgan. Go look in abyss. It look back.

After Gurgan&#8217;s friends looked into the hole, they spoke again.

> &lt;Duk&gt; We hollow too!
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt; \*shakes head in fearful agreement\*
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; Gurgan knows. Show you hollow make me feel less hollow. I think hard thoughts on hollow. I thinks we need to fill hollow.
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt; Not enough rocks to fill abyss!
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; NO, HOLLOW IN OGRES, STUPID.
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt; &#8230;
> 
> &lt;Duk&gt; &#8230;fill hollow with gobins?
> 
> <Gugan> No, not Gobins. Gobins not fill hollow. But think hard thoughts- gobins not hollow. Gobins find meaning. They make stuffs like Gnomes.
> 
> &lt;Kibal&gt; We make stuff like Gnome, too?
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; No&#8230; We not make stuffs like Gnome. We do better- we _help_ Gnome make stuffs. We _help_ Dorf dig rocks. We _help_ Elf hug tree. We help orc-
> 
> &lt;Duk&gt; But no trees left to hug!
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; IT NOT MATTER DUK! What matter is we help. We help and it gives us meaning. It fills hollow.
> 
> &lt;Duk&gt; Duk not like hollow in Duk. If help make Duk full, Duk help. Duk even help gobins instead of eating gobins.
> 
> &lt;Gurgan&gt; OH- and show others abyss. Humans, orcs, buggybears, dorfs- they not care. Ogres care. Show all ogres abyss and they see they hollow, then they help.

And that&#8217;s how the Order of the Abyss was started, a pacifistic religious movement within the Ogre community. Weird, right?
